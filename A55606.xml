            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>WE find by daily experience that thoſe Rivers which run from the pureſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the farther they run, the more corruption they gather: and ſo is it with the Church and Common-wealth, which have had their inſtitutions, diſcipline and lawes drawn from the pure fountains of piety, prudence and equity; yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50324:3"/>by the courſe of time they are carried through the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in manners, defects in government, and in the execution of good Lawes, into a ſtream of abuſes, contempt and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But when the corruptions are ſuch as are not incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but removable, we find it much better to content our ſelves with a fair, orderly and prudent reformation, or a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary toleration, then by adventuring raſhly upon the cure, make the diſeaſe worſe, or change it into as bad, through the change of that which hath long continued, and may very fitly be retained, and eaſily be purged from the corruptions and abuſes which are adherent. For by Innovations, eſpecially ſudden, the minds of men are diſquieted, fuel is brought unto fiery and turbulent ſpirits, and the peace of the Church and Common-wealth indangered, if not deſtroyed, which by the Apoſtolical precept and practiſe we ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to preſerve. The rule which <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> giveth us is worth remembrance, <hi>In rebus novis conſtituendis evidens eſſe debeat utilitas, ut ab eo jure quod diu aequum fuit recedatur.</hi> It is an evident ſign of a diſtemperature in the brain, or of great levity, when we raſhly ruſh upon the change of ancient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and cuſtomes, if there can be found no great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience in the uſe of them. The deſire of change is reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and like ſuperſtition taking hold in the minds of men, when it hath broken the bounds of piety. Alterations are dangerous, although they are ſpecious, and have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to juſtifie them; and oftentimes thoſe are the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, which are moſt ſpecious, eſpecially if they are driven on tumultuouſly, or by faction. When the people begin to be divided in Religion, or to ſhew themſelves diſcontented with the preſent government, then do the ambitious and factious ſpirits (who fiſh beſt in troubled waters) lay in their hooks and make uſe of the ſeaſon and opportunity. And it hath been often obſerved, that thoſe who have had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon the State, or to become a head of a Faction, to raiſe ſedition, or to poſſeſſe or alter the Government, have ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Religion or the Publick good, or the reformation of abuſes, and the removing of evil Counſellors.

But we can find none, or very few of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ancient Hereticks, Sectaries, or Schiſmaticks quarrel with Epiſcopacy, but all theſe of our time jump together in no one point ſo near as they do againſt Epiſcopacy. Thoſe Chriſtians who are now diſperſed in divers parts of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> although they are of different Sects, do not admit of any other form in Eccleſiaſtical Government but Epiſcopal; in this they agree. The ancient Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, who were as ſubtle men as theſe new, did not quarrel at the Function, ſo as they might have had Biſhops of their own ſide, or have been Biſhops themſelves: Their envy towards others, or their deſire of being preferred before others made many become pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of Hereſies, to the great prejudice of the Church, and the peace thereof. Concerning the oppoſition againſt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy and Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline (wherein full defence hath been made by divers learned and pious men) I ſhall not ſay much, although the matter deſerveth to be more fully and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly handled. Much may be ſaid againſt the tyranny and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition under the Papacy, and againſt other abuſes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal faults, yet may we not thereby infer a neceſſity of the change of the Epiſcopal order and office into Presbytery, which is ſubject to as many and great abuſes, as they finde who live under it. It is not without juſt cauſe that thoſe men who would be reputed learned and pious ſhould receive blame, for their ſo eager and bitter conteſting againſt the ſuperiority of one man in Church Government, even to the rending of the Church in pieces; when they do not define or declare by the Scriptures, notwithſtanding all their labour what is of neceſſary and perpetual obligation in this controverſie. And of all thoſe things which they have urged in their own behalf as greatly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Church Government, there is no one which they have proved to be contained in Scripture, and injoyned for perpetuity: but in ſtead of this proof, they obtrude conjectural and ſlight interpretations, uncertain probabilities, and as weak inferences in oppoſition of the primitive and continual judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practiſe of the Church.

               <p>AS they would have it granted that their Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is onely of Divine right, ſo would they alſo have it granted, that nothing is to be uſed in Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that which hath direct and expreſs warrant in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and that all diſcipline and order in the Church, ought to be reduced to the primary purity of the Church, which is not poſſible in many things, neither neceſſary or expedient in theſe corrupt times, and latter age of the world. An exact form for all Church government and diſcipline is not to be found expreſſed in the Scripture. For one cauſe of ſo many general Councils in the firſt times, and ſhortly after, was to make Canons and Conſtitutions for the external Government of the Church, which had not needed, if ſuch a perfect Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form had been delivered in the Scripture, as theſe men do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.

We ought well to conſider what things are of Divine right and precept, and what are properly, poſitive and Eccleſiaſtical conſtitutions; what things are of Divine Right according to the matter and ſubſtance, and are of humane inſtitution according to their forms preſcribed: All are of weight, although not equally: What ought to be perpetual in the Church, and what is changeable by poſitive Laws; What is Moral, what is Ceremonial, leſt the defects of our judgement cauſe us to abound in our own ſenſe, and lead us into an erroneous or perplexed conſcience. Some things are of Divine inſtitution and right, yet do not alwayes belong unto faith;<note place="margin">Biſh. of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt. Epiſt to P.

Moreover, although the conſtitutions of men, are not of force in themſelves to bind the conſcience, yet do men ſin in wilfully diſobeying ſuch Laws and conſtitutions, as are by Lawful Authority eſtabliſhed, when they can ſhew no other cauſe for their diſobedience, but their conſcience, neither bring any warrant out of Gods Word.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50324:12"/>moral duties and works are ſignified. Such rights and Ceremonies as are not repugnant to Gods Word, neither apt to lead men into ſuperſtition and to will-worſhip, but ſerving to edification and decent ſervice, ſo as the Church be not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with the multitude of them, nor the eſſence of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on placed in them, although ſome of them have been in part u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Pagans or Papiſts, leſt upon ſuch reſtraint we preſs too much ſervitude upon the Church. We cannot take in too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny helps for our performance of Religious duties, for the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Gods glory and goodneſs, for the more decency in his ſervice, for the manifeſtation of our duty of thankfulneſs, and for the furtherance of our devotion, ſo as Superſtition and Will-worſhip be reſtrained. And in all this if men ſhould be left to their own wills, the Church of God would alwayes be perplexed and grieved, and the peace thereof diſlurbed with infinite Scandals both given and taken. A great evil it were that order and decency ſhould break the Communion of Saints, which hath been ſo piouſly inſtituted for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof, and the increaſe of devotion, and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of our thankfulneſs to God for all his benefits. They ought to find other cauſes for their diſlike of Ceremonies, then becauſe ſome of them were uſed in time of Popery. The Reformed Churches retain ſome things uſed in the Romane Church. And they uſe the Churches, which not onely the Papiſts enjoyed, but ſome Churches which had been Temples of the Pagan gods. If they quarrel with our Ceremonies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were uſed in the Roman Church, without any other reaſon, they are like thoſe who hate men for other mens ſake, or becauſe of the company wherein they find them.

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the changes in Religion in <hi>England;</hi> And by <hi>Luther;</hi> And the toleration of divers Religions.</head>
               <p>THe Profeſſors of the Proteſtant Religion, were at firſt, and have been ſince taxed, as ſeditious and deſpiſers of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and advancers of Popular licentiouſneſs, and that their Reformation in Religion proceeded from faction, or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into faction and tumults, notwithſtanding all their publick Confeſſions of their Faith, and declarations of their Doctrine ſet forth in deteſtation thereof, wherein they did fully profeſs their obedience unto the Civil Magiſtrate.<note place="margin">Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory.</note> But it hath been very antient and uſual to lay that general charge of raiſing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when the malice hath been greater then the matter, and no other ſpecial crime could be found. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was accuſed for being a <hi>peſtilent fellow and a raiſer of ſedition. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſaith, Chriſtians in his time were called <hi>hoſtes publici,</hi> enemies of all Common-wealths; and <hi>Suetonius</hi> doth moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly ſay, <hi>Judaeos impulſore Chriſto aſſiduò tumultuantes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In vits Claudii l. <hi>15.</hi> hiſt.</note> and ſo Tacitus ſaith, that Nero, <hi>Reos quaeſitiſſimis poenis affecit, quos per flagitia inviſos vulgus Chriſtianos appellabat; unde quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam adverſus ſontes, &amp; noviſſima exempla meritos, miſeratio oriebatur, tanquam non utilitate publica, ſedin ſaevitiam unius abſumerentur;</hi> thus happeneth to all a like meaſure, who lye under the publick hatred. It is true that the change of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Germany and in other parts of Chriſtendome was driven on in a tumultuary courſe, and was not wrought in ſuch a calm as it was in England, where theſe changes went formerly in an orderly and quiet paſſage, under the conduct of a Royal power, and a prudent Council of State. Religion changed as it were by degrees and inſenſibly; all things ſeeming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſame courſe and ſtate as before: and as one obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it was in thoſe times ſo carried with us, <hi>ut Catholicam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionem ſine ſenſu Plebs exueret, cultu in ſpecie eodem manente.</hi> The Parliaments in England in thoſe times gave much counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50324:18"/>and authority to thoſe alterations with the People. The Kings and Queens would hardly have effected it, <hi>Regiâ manu,</hi> notwithſtanding their power, and the love they had of their People. The Parliaments were wrought not onely to rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,<note place="margin">Riba Jinera del Schiſmad Ingla terra.</note> but to be petitioners for thoſe changes in Religion. A ſtranger writeth that when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown, religion was not altered with violence, and bloud, as in France, Scotland, and the Low-countryes, but changed and eſtabliſhed by Laws, by Royal mandates, and with Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary concurrence, which ſaith he, hath been a ſubtil and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full invention armed with the authority of Prince and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for the ſure rooting and ſettlement of ſects and hereſies. Theſe quiet alterations formerly were even marvellous in our eyes,<note place="margin">Lord Chanc. S. Albans of the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Scotland.</note> and as it were a ſelicity peculiar unto our nation, as was ſaid of that change upon the death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the coming in of King <hi>James,</hi> who acknowledging to the Lords of England their great loyalty in his coming to the Crown, ſaid, that it was a ſucceſs above the courſe of nature, to have ſo great a change with ſo great a quiet. In Germany, France, Scotland, and other parts of Europe, many of the Contrivers and Actors in the reformation of religion, did neither <hi>ſapere ad ſobrietatem</hi> neither <hi>agere cum ſobrietate,</hi> eſpecially when they were ſtrongly oppoſed, and perceived divers deſigns for their deſtruction: for ſome of them had a mixture in their heads of the Anabaptiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal leaven, and were infected with that fury. Inſomuch as <hi>Bucer</hi> a man of great learning and moderation would often ſay unto them, that in their great heat of zeal in rectifying the ſervice of God, and reforming the Church, good order and diſcipline failing amongſt them, the tumultuous and ſeditious perſons were not chaſtiſed, neither any order and decency in the ſervice of God obſerved; and therefore their laudable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours would not long laſt, neither happily ſucceed: for the diſcreet and moderate men amongſt them, and thoſe in greateſt authority were oftentimes compelled to ſuffer many enormities and outragious actions, leſt by enforeing correction and diſcipline, they ſhould loſe the aſſiſtance and affection of their own party.<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> The Captains durſt not take the boldneſs to puniſh, as the fouldiers did to offend: voluntary obedience maketh the command and power weak, as is that power which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50324:18"/>cannot ſubſiſt by its own ſtreng. Before <hi>Luther</hi> was in his grave, and when his reformation was but in the infancy, ſome who ſeemed, or were reputed his diſciples, brake out of their pretended integrity through an over zealous and irregular deſire of reformation into abominable opinions and furies, tending to the deſtruction of all Goverment in Church and Common-wealth. And <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine alſo meeting with divers of weak and turbulent Spirits, over greedy of reformation, and abounding with wild zeal, or Spiritual pride, all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious liquor they received turned into gall and vinegar, and from theſe did ſeeds ſoon ſpring up, which raiſed a ſwarm of<note n="*" place="margin">Theſe Anabaptiſts then ſtarted up, and declared that they had ſpeech with God, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to deſtroy all the wicked and to taiſe a new world in which the godly onely ſhould live and reign. <hi>Sleidans Comment. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Fox</hi> Acts and Monuments.</note> Anabap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Jews are permitted the free exerciſe of their religion in ſome Chriſtian countries, which is denyed to thoſe they do account Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks, and the reaſon is given, becauſe they pollute and violate the Chriſtian religion which they profeſſe, and diſturb the Peace of the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth

As God hath ſet Kings in the higheſt place and office, and intruſted them with the greateſt authority on earth, and will therefore take the ſtricteſt account of them, ſo cannot they eſcape his heavieſt judgements, who are choſen to counſel him in his greateſt affairs, and do not onely fail in their duty, but do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude themſelves into his office, and hinder him in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his oath, and in performance of his duty to God and his people. As the eſtates in Parliament ought to be Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators of the Rights and Liberties of the People, ſo ought they to be of their own bounds and limits, in which if they exceed, they do alſo give an ill example to all other inferiour Courts of Juſtice, (ſubject to their care and regulation), to the hindrance of Juſtice and diſtribution of common right

And although Parliaments are called for juſt cauſes, and do ſit in full liberty and freedome, yet doth it often happen as in ſome General Councils called for the extirpation of Hereſies and Schiſmes, and the preſervation of the Church and the peace thereof, that they being not at peace among themſelves before they came, neither bringing with them the love of truth and minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to peace and moderation; the former evils (for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation whereof they were called) were not taken away, but ſtrengthened and augmented, and diverſe others raiſed: for thoſe men are moſt unfit for counſel who have their minds wholly poſſeſſed with perturbations and jealouſies, or their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations bent unto faction, or any ſmiſter deſigns.

For in other Aſſemblies, Councels and Courts, there is not as in Parliament, of all Perſons, ſtates and degrees, either perſonally or virtually by repreſentation, and intendment of Law, the preſence, and as it ought to be to make a juſt and compleat Parliament, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ancient and continued Laws and cuſtomes of this

And therefore to help themſelves any other way-rather then to reſt upon any aſſurance which their Prince can give, if they diſtruſt their own ſtrength, they have often put themſelves under the protection of a forraign Prince, and, as <hi>Bodin</hi> obſerveth, from Clients they fall to be Subjects, and ſoone after from Subject; they become ſlaves.

Moreover thoſe who have been contrivers and chief actors in a Rebellion, and have affrighted and cheated the People out of their Allegeance, and quiet eſtate, and drawn them to their faction, they are like thoſe Ringleaders in the Rebellion of the Roman Colonie, who when they found many of their followers inclined to ſend a ſupplication to Rome, they could not indure it,<note place="margin">Livius lib. <hi>6.</hi>

But this was, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>to ſtrengthen themſelves in their wickedneſs, and to worke their iniquity by a Law.</hi> The King might as well have granted them jurisdiction over any City or County of his Kingdome independent as unto himſelfe, and exempt from his authority and the Laws of the Realm, and without appeal to his ſupream Court: and he might as well have paſſed away his peculiar right of pardoning offences, and deſpenſing with penal Statutes.

And like this, was that other act, and of the ſame leaven and mould with that act of the MILITIA, which was made for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the Parliament, until both Houſes ſhould agree for the diſſolving of it. But they did not ſtay for that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for the Parliament was diſſolved againſt their will, by the irruption of the ſoldiers. And yet before that, they did diſſolve it themſelves, although beſides their intention, when they deſerted the King and his authority, and acted contrary to their writ of ſummons, and to the rights of both King and People: But more apparently when they ſuppreſſed the Houſe of Peers, and ran away moſt part of them together with their ſpeaker unto the protection of the Army, and ſo became the Armies Parliament, under which power they ſtill afterwards did ſit and act, leaving the Parliament without any Lawful adjournment, <hi>ſine die, ſine capite, ſine corpore.</hi> This Law for continuation of the Parliament, ſo directly contrary to the inſtitution, and eſſence of Parliaments, and the undoubted right of Kings to call and diſſolve Parliaments, was another new and ſtrange Law; <hi>Lex nova &amp; inaudita,</hi> as was ſaid of the Roman Law <hi>Agraria,</hi> from which great ſeditions took their firſt riſe, and from thoſe ſeditions Civil wars, which never were fully ended, until that Common-wealth was utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the uſurpation of <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50324:34"/>fitly in many reſpects be compared to this Law <hi>Agraria,</hi> which <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> the Tribune of the People preferred to flatter the People, to continue himſelfe in his office, that he might be the more ſafe from the Nobility and rich men his enemies, &amp; the better bring his deſignes to effect. This Law, being very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the Commons, <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> revived, to aſſure the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto him, and to obtain their compliance with his uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. It was a law ſeditious in it ſelf, ſerving aptly to imbaſe and make contemptible the Majeſty of the Senate and Conſuls, but in reſpect of the meanes uſed to make it paſs with their votes, it was abominable: for tumults were raiſed on purpoſe, and ſuch violence was offered to one of the Conſuls for oppoſing it, that the Enſigns of office carried before him were broken,<note place="margin">Plutarch in the lives of Caeſar and Pompey.</note> and a basket of duſt thrown upon his head, and two Tribunes and ſome others in his company were wounded: and ſoon after came to an end the Roman glory, and their liberty. Inſomuch as many of the wiſeſt, ſeeing the madneſs of the People, and their contempt of Laws and their former government, thought themſelves happy, if the Common-wealth was no worſe afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then with the burthen of an abſolute Monarchy. It is not the retaining of ſome of the uſual form and ſolemnity, as was in the making our two Statutes, that maketh a binding law, if the principal and eſſential parts and properties of a Law be wanting. For a Law hath no force nor virtue, when the material and final cauſes and reaſons of a juſt Law do ceaſe and are determined, and the execution of that Law would prove injurious or abſurd. And ſo a Law or Grant whoſe foundation and ground is laid upon a fiction or preſumption of a fact, or thing which never had any exiſtence and being,<note place="margin">Medina. Felin &amp; alii.

Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intention of both King and People, and contrary to the reaſons on which their rights and liberties are grounded, and contrary to the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and contrary to the office and duty of thoſe elected members, and to the nature and quality of all delegated power and authority, Procurators, Deputies or Repreſentatives, became maſters of all, and perpetual Dictators, and did work all their iniquity by a Law.</p>
               <p>There is another way of fraud uſed to circumvent Princes, which is to obſerve an opportunity offered them by occaſion of ſome neceſſities and ſtraits, into which Princes often fall. Many learned men affirme, that all bindings and tyes of Kings,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50324:37"/>although by vertue of a Law, upon the onely advantage taken of their neceſſities and ſtraits in their affairs, maketh the breach of that Law juſtifiable, inasmuch as any conſtrained aſſent, is never reputed a Royal aſſent, neither a durable aſſent. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many examples there is one of our glorious King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in or about the fifteenth year of his reign, who went roundly to worke in ſuch caſe, and voided certain things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly granted by himſelfe in Parliament, alleadging that thoſe things by him granted were contrary to his oath, and the rights of his Crown, which he granted not of his free will, but that he diſſembled at that time, to avoid thoſe eminent dangers which would have enſued upon his denial. Yet may we not approve <hi>Machiavils</hi> doctrine,<note place="margin">Cap. 18. of his Prince.</note> that Princes may without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour break their faith, when the obſervation thereof turneth againſt themſelves, or the cauſe which urged them to promiſe doth ceaſe; albeit mans aſſent or denyal is feeble and defective, when he is ſurrounded with inextricable difficulties, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with violent perturbations, and then to take an advantage thereof, is neither fair nor firm: for when ſtrong and violent perturbations and affections have poſſeſſed the mind, all Laws allow them for juſt cauſes of qualifications of offences, and mitigation of puniſhment in moſt caſes:<note place="margin">Sereca.</note> 
                  <hi>Non eſt facile inter mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na mala non deſipere, &amp; quid mirum eſt, animos inter dolorem &amp; metum oberraſſe?</hi> They who ſeeke to hold Princes, or other men to the ſtrict obſervation of promiſes, drawn by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage taken of their neceſſities and diſtreſſe, can never have any ſure hold of ſuch promiſes, neither of their affections.

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Againſt any power pretended to depoſe Princes; Of the Allegiance of the Subjects; Of the oath of the King; and of his Coronation: Of ſtrangers joyning in Arms with ſubjects in Rebellion againſt their Soveraign; Of oathes and ingagements made to Tyrants and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</head>
               <p>I Come now from their ſeditious practiſes, which I leave to their repentance, unto the relation of ſome of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Principles, which ſeem to be their Fundamentals. To relate all thoſe they ſometime do mention, if it were poſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet were it to little purpoſe; Errours are prone to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication; one begetteth another. They affirm boldly that <hi>if a King perform not his duty, his Subjects may compell him to it; and that they are bound to obey him no longer, then he doth govern according to his Lawes. That the People may depoſe him, from whom he hath his power;</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The People who are a Party muſt be the ſole Judges, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Accuſers. And they would have it granted, that Kings hold their Crowns but conditionally, and generally from the election of the People. If theſe be not granted, their cauſe will fall to the ground, for they want proof to ſupport it. The duty we owe to our Soveraign, to our Parents, to our wives, and which the vaſſal oweth to his Lord, which is the weakeſt of theſe, are neither of them conditional, upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance on their part. If this doctrine ſhould be received,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50324:45"/>all the world would fall into conſuſion. Mutual and correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive duties ought not thus eaſily and perniciouſly to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. It is againſt Chriſtian Doctrine to requite evil with evil; neither doth the Lawes allow (as it doth in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) Retaliations, Compenſations, or Relaxations of ſuch nature. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, <hi>there are duties to be performed toward ſome perſons, from whom we have received injuries.</hi> This doctrine were as ill for the Subjects as for the Prince, if they breake the bonds of their duty to him, and he thereupon ſhould put them out of his protection, and ſhew himſelfe a woolfe, and not a ſhepherd, and afford them neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, Juſtice, nor mercy, unto all which he is bound by his duty to God and his People. The Doctors of the Laws are much perplexed in debating theſe two Rules in Law, the one is, that <hi>in vain he requireth the performance of a promiſe or contract, to whom he refuſeth the performance of that which he ought on his part to performe:</hi> the other is, <hi>that a man is not bound to performe his oath, if that be not performed to him, in conſideration whereof he did ſwear:</hi> and unto theſe rules they aſtigne diverſe exceptions and limitations; one is, that regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,<note place="margin">

               <p>AFter our adverſaries have made their allegations with ſome verbal flouriſhes; as that there is a natural right in all Societies to the power of Rule, and from the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and Communities of People, it is derived to one or more Perſons: and although Supream and univerſal Power be acknowledged to be in Kings, yet not ſo as to exclude the whole State of thoſe Societies conjoyned, and bar the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of that power, which they have originally over Kings. Then for the proof of this they do offer one reaſon, which is, that every independent People (if they have or can find any ſuch) being driven from their Countrey by any accidents, and ſcattered upon the face of the earth, being forſaken by thoſe who had the rule and power over them, if they unite again, they have a natural right unto Supream authority, and may conſtitute ſuch form of Government as pleaſeth them. As it was the caſe of the Romans when they came firſt from ruined <hi>Troy,</hi> and planted themſelves in <hi>Italy.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Venetians,</hi> forced to forſake their habitations upon the firm land, and to plant themſelves in thoſe Mariſhes and little Iſlands in the <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick</hi> Sea, where <hi>Venice</hi> now ſtandeth, there built and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified themſelves againſt thoſe barbarous People, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran the nobleſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> againſt whom they could have no protection from the Roman Emperour, their Soveraign. In theſe reſpects they juſtly challenge that City, and the Sea with the Dominion thereof. And although it be farther gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that a people in ſuch caſe may chooſe any form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50324:63"/>And that a people, and commonalty alſo, have right to chooſe a King upon the failing of the Royal line; becauſe Regal Right and Dominion, where there is none left to inherit it, neither head to rule over it, cometh to the body and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty for preſervation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> human ſociety: yet all this help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not our adverſaries. It cometh nothing to the proof, that all Kings hereditary hold their authority as derived from the people, and that it ſtill remaineth habitually in the people, and that although Supream power be acknowledged to be in Kings, yet not ſo as to exclude the whole ſtate of thoſe Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties conjoyned, and bar the influence of that power, which they have originally over Kings. Neither can they draw good arguments, and eſpecially general concluſions from ſingular and extraordinary events and examples, or from actions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced for the ſafety of the People, which is the ſupream Law. Neceſſity often findeth a juſtifyable ſupply, upon the fayling of Gods own ordinances, expreſly injoyned to be obſerved, if otherwiſe the moſt neceſſary duties would fail to be performed. <hi>Sed quae propter neceſſitatem recepta ſunt,</hi>

Upon this aſſertion was grounded the damnable opinion and practiſes of the <hi>Spencers</hi> in <hi>Edward</hi> the Seconds time: and very probable it is that this opinion made the way more ſmooth and eaſy for depoſing that King, by the infection it infuſed, and the influence it had upon that Parliament.

The Politick capacity of the King which never dyeth, never ceaſeth, is inſeparably annexed unto his natural perſon untill his death, and both are conjoyned at the very inſtant, that the right of the Crown de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth unto him, which giveth a new qualification to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural perſon, and life and vertue to his Office and function.

               <p>THeſe pretended Patrons of Popular liberty, or rather of licentiouſneſs and confuſion, can find no way ſo meet in their conceit, for maintaining their Plots, as parity in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Government, which being once eſtabliſhed in the Church, by the example thereof,<note place="margin">King <hi>James</hi> book to his Son.</note> the Politick and civil State ſhould be drawn to the like. And therefore they will have an actual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to be joyntly in the People with their Soveraign in making of Lawes, which they call their Legiſlative power in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo as they would leave unto the King little or no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer with his negative voice, and would weaken all his rights in Parliament, but eſpecially his right of diſſolving Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They would make him inferiour to the Roman Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the people;<note place="margin">Livius. Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch.</note> for any one of them by his negative voice could croſs that which his Colleagues propoſed to the People, and any two of them could ſtop all proceedings, and diſſolve all the ſolemn aſſemblies of the people, called by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the other Tribunes. But ſay what they can, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find his Legiſlative power, to be any other thing then the Regal power, and a principal part and branch thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in many caſes it be very juſtly reſtrained in the uſe and exerciſe thereof to the Kings ſitting in his Parliament, his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Court and Councel, with all the eſtates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but this is not in reſpect of any power or original and habitual right inherent in the people.

By which courſe the juſt rights and liberties of the people are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and taxes and levies of money on the people impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, onely by Parliamentary authority, as they ought to be. For thus the People are induced and ingaged, to a willing obſervation of thoſe lawes, and ſubmiſſion unto thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, for the making and raiſing whereof they have given their conſent. It was ſaid long ſince by a wiſe man, that in ancient time and to the honour of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Commines.</note> it was beſt governed of any Kingdome; the People leaſt oppreſſed, the Kings living upon their own revenues; ſubſidies granted but onely for war with <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the war under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the advice of Parliament: by which means the King was the ſtronger and better ſerved: and he addeth alſo that Princes cannot levy on their Subjects without their conſent. If we look upon our moſt ancient Statutes or rather Charters of our Kings, and the form and ſtile of them, we ſhall find no Character of any legiſlative power in any but in the King, neither ſo much as the Peoples concurrence or conſent in any Parliamentary way. It appeareth in our ancient Hiſtories,<note place="margin">Mat. Paris. Hoveden &amp; alii.</note> that during the Raign of diverſe Kings after the Norman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, the Kings when they called their great Councel or Parliament, the ſummons went only to the Prelates, Earls, and Barons; and in ſome of thoſe Hiſtories there is mention of calling the Commonalty, and diverſe ſage and wiſe men. In Kings <hi>Johns</hi> time the firſt ſummons upon record appeareth to the Prelates and Peers,<note place="margin">S. Rob. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons collections</note> and ſomething may be gathered although darkly of the admittance of the Commons. Before that time every man by his tenure held himſelfe to his great Lords will, in whoſe aſſent his dependent Tenents was included:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50324:71"/>Theſe were long after the Conqueſt taxed and aſſeſſed by the conſent of their Lords of whom they held, who enjoyed great Regalities in their Signiorîes, and were to their vaſſalls <hi>totidem Tyranni,</hi> ſaith <hi>Mat. Paris.</hi> Theſe great Lords did ſo curb and reſtrain a long time the King, that there was great danger they would have raiſed an Ariſtocracy, or ſeveral petty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, ſo lofty was their carriage towards their King, which in time would have ſtrangled the Monarchy, and all under the pretence of the publick good, which drew on that long and deſtructive war called the Barons war, and made it the more plauſible and popular. After theſe combuſtions ended, and the King, the Lords, and people, were reduced to reaſon and moderation, which often was wanting on both ſides; then the Statutes made in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt and <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, had theſe words, <hi>Statutes made by the King in Parliament, at the requeſt and petition of the Commenalty, with the aſſent of the Prelates and Pears:</hi> And ſo in the Fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, at the inſtance and ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Commons with the aſſent of the Prelates and Peers, we have ordained and eſtabliſhed; and ſo in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding raign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and in the firſt of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Fourth. Thus did the force and efficacy of our Lawes proceed from the Kings Legiſlative power, acting by and with the concurrence of the three Eſtates in Parliament, contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their aſſiſtance, according to their reſpective duties and the truſt repoſed on them. This concurrence doth ſerve ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently for the direction, regulation, and in ſome reſpect for the qualification, not for the diminution, but for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Kings power and rights. The abſoluteneſs and generality of this Regal power, being alſo in many caſes often reſtrained, in the adminiſtration of Juſtice, in the inferiour Courts of Juſtice by the Common Law of England, and by the Lawes and cuſtomes of other Kingdomes: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aſſiſtance and concurrence of all the Eſtates in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament cannot amount unto the raiſing of any coequality or competition of power: the influence of the Soveraign power is that which giveth life to the making and to the execution of all Lawes: both Houſes of Parliament acting according to their duties, and not exceeding their bounds, the rights and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50324:71"/>prerogative of the King is neither reſtrained nor obſcured, but guided, ſtrengthned and carried with greater vigour and Majeſty, for his and the Peoples moſt good and ſecurity. If our Kings had any co-partners in the Legiſlative power, or were leſs in Parliament then when they were out, our Judges have been much out, and deceived him and others in affirming oftentimes to the Kings, that in no time they were ſo high in their Royal eſtate, as when they ſate in Parliament. The Canon-Lawyers ſay, the Pope is greater when he ſitteth in a General Council, in reſpect of the amplitude of knowledge, and the ſpirit of diſcerning. After the Romans had transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all their Supream power to their Emperours, yet did the Senate afterwards make divers Lawes, called <hi>Senatus conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> which were often concomitant, or ſubſequent to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Edicts, yet this was never held to be a conferring or communicating of any part of the Legiſlative Imperial po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: no otherwiſe the Kings of <hi>France</hi> do grant to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris,</hi> when their arreſts concurr with the Kings Edicts, which are there uſually ratified:<note place="margin">Cujacius, &amp; Pet.

               <p>Our Innovators do not reſt at the quarrel againſt the Kings legiſlative power, and other his Regal rights; but many of them fly at his whole prerogative: The very name is odious unto them, through ignorance or malice. The prerogative of the King, is ſupported by the Common law of <hi>England,</hi> and it doth often ſerve to ſupport the Law, and the rights of all men; both of them do give and receive vertue and ſtrength to and from each other. The Emperours in their Lawes ſay, <hi>Authoritate juris penàct noſtra authoritas.</hi> The Regal prerogative,<note place="margin">Ld. Chanc. Sir Edward Coke poſtnati.</note> is called <hi>Lex Coronae,</hi> and it hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been reputed a part of the Common Law of England, and ſo <hi>lex Eccleſiae Anglicanae, &amp; lex terrae:</hi> and this <hi>lex terrae</hi> doth, as formerly our regular Parliaments ever did, fence and incloſe the prerogative within its juſt limits, as well for the ſafety and preſervation thereof, as for the welfare of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which being the ſupream law is the ſcale and meaſure of the Kings prerogative. For there is great uſe of the Kings prerogative, eſpecially when the ordinary courſe of law cannot
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50324:73"/>afford that help, or at leaſt ſo ſpeedily as is neceſſary, not only to prevent injuſtice and wrong unto private men, but alſo the prejudice or damage of the Common-wealth, peradventure irremedial.<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> Oftentimes, <hi>tarda ſunt legum auxilia.</hi> But as the ſame author ſaith, <hi>non utendum Imperio, ubi legibus agi poteſt,</hi> according to the rule in law, <hi>qui communi auxilio munitus ſit, non debet uti extraordinario remedio.</hi> The prerogative is not to croſs, and ſuppreſs the ordinary courſe of law and Juſtice, if it may be avoided, to the prejudice of the juſt rights and liberties of the people:<note place="margin">Pſalm 99.</note>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Of a Civil war, and of the effects thereof.</head>
               <p>I ſhall now draw towards a Concluſion, and in my paſſage ſhew the fruits of our adverſaries wit and labour, which have been rebellion, civil war and ſervitude; with ſome examples of their forerunners in other countries, which they have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, being they were more apt to imitate and magnify any example of rebellion, then to take warning by their calamities, or to conſider the ruine of their own Countrey, and the great ſcandal they have given unto the Chriſtian name. To begin with that which was neareſt to us, the late memorable example in <hi>France,</hi> where they of the Reformed religion, for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and liberty of conſcience, as they ſet it forth in their Declarations and Proteſtations, made an Aſſociation, and took
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50324:75"/>up arms. And ſoon after thoſe of the Roman religion, made the like Aſſociation, about the year 1576. which they called the holy League.<note place="margin">Thuanus.</note> Both theſe produced the moſt dangerous rebellion and civil war in all reſpects, that ever fell upon that Kingdome, or any other Chriſtian Kingdome; for the people generally fell into ſuch a phrenſy, that they deſerced their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance, charity, religion and reaſon. Into theſe Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many were at the firſt drawn unadviſedly, through diverſe and different perturbations in their minds, deſigns and intereſts: ſome upon falſe apprehenſions and reports of the King and others, cunningly raiſed: Others through diſcontent, want of livelyhood, hope of raiſing their fortune, hatred one of another, or of the preſent government, or of thoſe of the greateſt power therein: and many out of prepoſterous and wild zeal. And when repentance found entrance, they could not find any way out of this Egyptian darkneſs. The Cathoilck league was carried on with much ſubtilty and power, by the cheif of the faction, men of great power in Court, and with the ſeduced and violent people: Unto this league by ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, the King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third gave connivance; and out of a deſire to ſuppreſs ſome popular fears and jealouſies of him, and to ſhew himſelfe really a devout ſon of the Church, he ſoon declared himſelfe a party. And finding this Catholick league overmaſter him, he fell to no better ſhift, then the confirming and ratifying of it by his authority. But ſoon after that he perceived the deſign of the cheifeſt amongſt them, tended to the weakning and ſubordination of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by many of their actions, and cheifly by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> into their own hands, and all under the colour of defending the Catholick religion, and the extirpation of Hereſy. For prevention thereof, and preſervation of himſelf from contempt (into which he did run by joyning himſelfe to the league) he ſought to throw out the devil by <hi>Belzebub,</hi> and all that he could do could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſt thoſe inextricable difficulties, in which it pleaſed God to leave him, although he was a Prince indued with prudence and fortitude, and, as was ſaid of him, he might have proved an excellent King, if he had not fallen into ſuch times But he laboured and ſtrugled under the contempt and hatred of his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50324:76"/>people, either of them being ſufficient to draw deſtruction upon Princes: and the affection of his ſubjects was faſtned upon the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> a great Lord in reſpect of his alliance and followers, exceeding popular, ambitious, active, and of excellent parts. Under this new league and aſſociation, new officers were choſen, ſoldiers and mony raiſed, and war with the Proteſtants waged. The League was acknowledged to be the head; the King became an acceſſary, and not the principal; A prepoſterous and deformed government erected; into the body a new head ingraffed, and the old laid aſide, not cut off, but made of no vigour, and ſo was a hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then did it ſoon appear, that thoſe armes taken up for religion, by the actions and the accidents enſuing, were turned againſt the King, who too late cauſed the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the Cardinal his brother to be ſlain, the which act drew on the Tragedy to the height, for the year after he himſelfe was murdered. Peradventure it will not ſeem impertinent, conſidering the likeneſs of our condition now in <hi>England,</hi>

And although he did ſee the death and deſtruction of many of them, yet was he driven to agree upon hard conditions, and to grant a pardon to them, to the great diſcontent of many, who had ſerved with much courage and fidelity, for his friends did ſee many malitious rebels in as good or better condition then themſelves. The Kings excuſe was, that he could not help
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50324:76"/>it, for he was inforced to expel one plague by another. And as it is related in the Hiſtory, when the King had effected peace, then did appear the incomprehenſible effects of a Civil war, driven to the height; Religion pretended on all ſides at firſt, caſt out at laſt, or uſed but as a ſtalking-horſe: the honeſt Families, the Cities and the people generally corrupted in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and brought to poverty: the Nobility moſt of them accuſtomed to rapine and licentiouſneſs, apt ſtill to retain that courſe of life: Unto thoſe who were oppreſſed with debts, or guilty of great crimes, peace the ineſtimable bleſſing of God, was a torment. Others were ready upon all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to take arms again, to maintain their prodigality, and wholly indiſpoſed to uſe any honeſt trade or civil courſe of life: and ſome to be revenged of their enemies, or to repair the loſſes they received in the former Civil wars. And as by the occaſion of the Roman civil war impoſitions and taxes intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable were laid, although then excuſable, yet many of them alterwards remained in time of peace; and ſo it hapned in <hi>France,</hi> after their war ended with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and their Civil war, which then followed, or rather came together.<note place="margin">Comines.</note> But the Kings of <hi>France</hi> had this advantage by their wars, eſpecially by the Civil wars, that they got better knowledge of the wealth and ability of their ſubjects, and what burthens they could bear, as well in times of peace as war, of which before they were ignorant. This evil bargain the people have gotten by the Ringleaders of their Rebellion. And as by the long Carthaginian war the <hi>Romans</hi> changed much their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and loſt their ancient diſcipline, and laudible cuſtomes; ſo did the <hi>French,</hi> who by the means of their Civil wars have had the ſeeds of faction and ſedition ſo ſcattered throughout the Kingdome, that they are alwayes apt to ſpring up, and as mens bodies which by long and lingring ſickneſs, being grown weake and feeble, ever breed new diſeaſes; ſo do vices increaſe in a Kingdome waſted by war of long continuance, which the Roman Cenſors finding <hi>ad mores hominum adverterunt,</hi>

               <p>Before we have done with Civil war and the effects, I will deliver ſome obſervations of the cauſes, which reach and come home to our caſe. The Roman Civil war, ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> did ſpring up <hi>ex connexione malarum cauſarum,</hi> and ſo did the Civil wars in <hi>France,</hi> and in other Kingdomes. Many of theſe cauſes at the firſt, are more eaſily prevented then foreſeen. The evils which proceed from internal and ſecret cauſes and corruptions, are with moſt difficulty diſcerned, and cured when they appear. The Phyſick applyed either for prevention, or the cure of the malady when it is grown to ſtrength, proveth oftentimes equally dangerous; and therefore an excellent prudence and dexterity is neceſſary in the conduct of affairs of this nature, where there is danger in precipitation, although in uſing the likelieſt means, as well as there is in flackneſs and delay. The cauſes alſo of rebellion are often ſecret, ſuddain and different. It is obſerved that ſome men have rebelled againſt their Prince for no cauſe that could be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and others who have received extraordinary favours, as well as thoſe who have received apparent injuries: As too much plenty and proſperity doth often make men to themſelves and to their Countrey the greateſt enemies; for ſeditions, ſaith <hi>Plato</hi> do often ariſe through too much plenty, as well as of much want. <hi>Tantae calamitatis cauſa,</hi>

               <p>ALthough the cauſe of a rebellion proceedeth not from ambition, revenge, or the like, but from actions of good intention, for reformation of the Church or Common-wealth, rebellion and civil war doth follow, yet ſuch men ought to conſider, that <hi>Sion is not built with blood,</hi>

Thoſe men who have been authors or actors in a Civil war, or a rebellion, can hardly excuſe themſelves by any pretences whatſoever. There are ſome crimes, that ignorance cannot ſerve for a Plea: <hi>Lex dat coercionem delictorum quae ſponte, vel ignorantia contrahuntur: vel caſu fortuito eveniente,</hi>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50324:79"/>of this degree and quality may fitly be compared to an errour committed in war, which according to the common proverb, is committed but once, and that once often ſerveth for all, and deſtroyeth all. This I leave to the conſideration of the members of the late long Parliament, and their adherents, and likewiſe this difficult queſtion, which hath perplexed many honeſt men, although few of this age do ever ſtick at it, Whether by the lawes divine and humane forbidding the reſiſtance of the ſoveraign authority juſtly eſtabliſhed, we are thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from all reſiſtance by armes, in defence of our goods, eſtates, juſt rights and liberties, when the reſiſtance cannot be made without hazard of other mens lives, and of ſedition and civil war. I will not inſiſt upon the deciſion thereof; it is a work of long labour, and not much pertinent. I will add this as a moſt undoubted truth, that a Civil war, or rebellion doth moſt commonly produce more pernicious effects in one year, then either the inſufficiency or Tyranny of a Prince can in an age. It was truly obſerved that the Roman State ſuffered more in thoſe ſeven months of civil war raiſed by <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> then in the fourteen years of that bloody war which <hi>Annibal</hi> waged in <hi>Italy</hi> at their own doores, although their loſs and damage was ineſtimable. <hi>Brutus</hi> perſwaded a wiſe man his friend to joyn with him in the Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> his friend anſwered him, that the government under a Tyrant was not ſo bad as a Civil war. Our fanatick Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who teach men rebellion, and to flatter and deceive the People, and to effect their own deſignes, do ſay, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power is originally in the People, and habitually inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in them, and is derived from them, ſo as they may chaſtiſe and change their Kings, and aſſume again their power. They do not conſider how by theſe improbable aſſertions they weaken the bonds of all lawes humane and divine, and cut the ſinewes of all magiſtracy and government: how they do incite the People to rebellion, and preſerve the ſeeds thereof alwayes in their heads and hearts: how they in leaving Kings to ſtand or fall according to the changable humours of their own ſubjects, who againſt common reaſon, they make to be judges, accuſers, witneſſes and parties; they leave Princes in the moſt miſerable condition of all men. And the People alſo,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50324:80"/>ever deſirous of innovations, and prone to all licentiouſneſs, when the reins are but ſlackned, they do expoſe to the fury of their provoked Soveraign by their rebellion, and to the loſs of their juſt rights and liberties, and perhaps to intolerable ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude under the ſword of a Conquerour. The Rivers which by ſome violent accident have broken their bounds, are deſtructive to themſelves, and to all round about them: They run on ſtill and ſcatter themſelves, and never come to good until they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the right Channel, and are incloſed and fenſed again within their proper and juſt bounds aſſigned unto them by God and Nature. I could not in this diſcourſe inſiſt upon the fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deducing of arguments, although they were neceſſary for confirmation of the truth, and confutation of falſhood; neither in drawing my matter into an exact method: my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was to relate the truth, and to rectify the judgments of the ignorant, for Gods glory, and the good of my Countrey, and to convince thoſe who are perverſe, not preſuming to teach the wiſe and learned, unto whoſe Judgments I do ſubmit.</p>
